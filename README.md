![Basin interpolation](https://raw.github.com/aurbano/SplineJS/master/img/screenshot-linear-basis.png "B-spline interpolation")

The code is still a bit messy, I will start organizing when it is more advanced and I have a better vision of it's internal structure.

If you want to contribute, I could use some help with d3.js integration, it's still a bit buggy and could be greatly improved.
